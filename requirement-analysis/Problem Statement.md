## **Problem Statement**

### **Complexity of Scholarship Applications:**

* Identifying and applying for the most suitable scholarships.  
* But with over 500+ scholarships available globally, varying criteria, and strict deadlines, it’s overwhelming to keep track of the opportunities.  
* Because there are no centralized tools or guidance to help manage the applications and deadlines.  
* Which makes one feel stressed and uncertain, induced by missed deadlines and the complexity of finding the right scholarships.

### **Standardized Testing Requirements:**

* One needs to prepare for standardized tests like IELTS, TOEFL, GRE, and GMAT, which are prerequisites for most scholarships and programs.  
* However, preparing for these tests while managing application timelines is overwhelming.  
* Because there’s no centralized platform to guide test preparations alongside the application process.  
* Which makes one feel unprepared, anxious, and prone to missing key testing deadlines.

### **Lack of Guidance on University Selection:**

* Trying to select a university and program that aligns with one’s academic interests and career goals.  
* But with over 2,000 universities worldwide, it is a struggle to narrow down the options and assess their suitability.  
* Because of the lack of tools and resources to compare institutions, rankings, and program details.  
* Which makes one feel lost and unsure about their decisions, resulting in poor application quality.

### **Challenges in Showcasing Achievements:**

* Tracking and showcasing academic achievements, extracurricular activities, and volunteer work for scholarship applications.  
* But without an organized platform, the achievements have to be manually compiled and organized, making it difficult to present them effectively.  
* Because there are no integrated tools to streamline this process.  
* Which makes one feel stressed and uncertain, induced by incomplete or disorganized applications.

### **Inadequate Support for Statement of Purpose (SOP) Writing:**

* Writing a compelling SOP to highlight my skills, goals, and motivations.  
* But the struggle with structuring and presenting the story effectively.  
* Because of no access to personalized templates, feedback, or editing services.  
* Which makes one feel anxious and less confident about the quality of my application.

### **Disorganization and Time Management Challenges:**

* Managing deadlines, documents, and submissions efficiently.  
* But the scattered nature of the process makes it hard to keep track of what has to be done and what’s pending.  
* Because there’s no centralized system to monitor progress and deadlines.  
* Which makes one feel overwhelmed and prone to missing important tasks.

### **Limited Access to Financial Aid Information:**

* Trying to find grants, assistantships, and student loans to fund my studies abroad.  
* But financial aid options are not clearly laid out or tailored to my needs.  
* Because the available information is scattered and difficult to verify.  
* Which makes one feel discouraged and uncertain about affording my education.

### **Automation Gap:**

* Simplifying the application process by automating repetitive tasks like filling out forms and submitting documents.  
* But there’s no platform to assist with these tasks and send timely reminders.  
* Because existing solutions are fragmented and lack comprehensive automation features.  
* Which makes one feel frustrated and more likely to delay or abandon my application process.

Problem Statement
1. Sourcing Reliable Scholarship and Program Data
The education landscape is dynamic, with new scholarships and programs being introduced regularly. However, sourcing this data from reliable and updated sources is a significant challenge. Many scholarships and university programs do not have centralized repositories, forcing students to scour multiple websites and platforms. This leads to missed opportunities and incomplete information.

2. Frequent Updates to Application Requirements
University and scholarship requirements often change without notice, such as eligibility criteria, required documents, or deadlines. Staying updated with these changes is a daunting task, especially for students who don’t have the time or expertise to monitor multiple platforms simultaneously.

3. Lack of a Unified System for Financial Aid Information
Financial aid opportunities, including grants, loans, and assistantships, are scattered across different websites and portals. Students often have to search manually and piece together information, which is time-consuming and prone to errors.

4. Managing Large Volumes of User-Generated Data
Our platform will handle data like academic records, extracurricular achievements, test scores, and personal statements from thousands of users. Without a robust data management system, it becomes difficult to ensure accuracy, prevent duplication, and provide personalized recommendations.

5. Automating Complex Processes
Students have to repeatedly fill out similar forms for different applications, such as university admissions, scholarships, and standardized tests. These repetitive tasks consume a lot of time and often result in errors. Automating such processes is technically challenging but necessary for an efficient user experience.

6. Providing Up-to-Date Resources for Standardized Test Preparation
Preparing for exams like IELTS, GRE, or GMAT requires access to the latest resources, practice tests, and tips. Without regular updates, these materials can become outdated, putting students at a disadvantage.

7. Creating Multilingual and Accessible Content
Many students in Bangladesh, especially from rural areas, may not be fluent in English or tech-savvy. Providing content in Bengali and ensuring the platform is intuitive for all users is a critical challenge.

8. Ensuring Data Privacy and Security
Collecting sensitive information such as academic records, financial details, and personal documents poses security risks. Any breach or misuse of data can result in loss of trust and legal liabilities.

9. Scalability of the Platform
As the platform grows, scaling its infrastructure to support more users and handle a large volume of data without compromising speed or performance is a major challenge.

10. Building Credibility and Trust Among Users
Students and parents are often skeptical of new platforms, especially when it involves providing sensitive information. Establishing credibility through reliable partnerships and consistent delivery of value is crucial for adoption.
